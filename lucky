it's a new file to test jenkins config test with maven when different branches get added changes
now adding few more lines with linux commands. 
for create new file we can use touch* cat >* or cat >>* 
touch creates file only
cat > will create and add some data in it in one command
cat >> it will add come more data to existed file.

if we want to exit from this cat >> command in linux we must use ctrl+c command to save doc and exit

its a additional line adding to this file to check the webhook testing purpose only.
